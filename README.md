## Install & setup instructions

### 1. Install the plugin
- Download the plugin from the [WordPress Plugin Store](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ledger-direct/) or the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/ledger-direct/ledger-direct-woocommerce).
- Upload the plugin to your WordPress installation:
  - Go to your WordPress admin panel
  - Navigate to "Plugins" > "Add New"
  - Click on "Upload Plugin"
  - Select the downloaded ZIP file and click "Install Now"
  - Activate the plugin after installation
  - Alternatively, you can install the plugin directly from the WordPress Plugin Store by searching for "LedgerDirect" in the "Add New" plugins section.

### 2. Configure the plugin
- Go to "WooCommerce" > "Settings" > "Payments"
- Find "LedgerDirect" in the list of payment methods and click "Manage"
- Enter your Merchant Wallet Address (the address where you want to receive payments)
- Configure any additional settings as needed (e.g., which network to use (Testnet or Mainnet), which currencies to accept, etc.)

## Available currencies:
- XRP (XRP Ledger)
- RLUSD (XRP Ledger)

To receive stablecoin payments, ensure you have the corresponding currencies (RLUSD, USDC etc.) enabled in the plugin settings.
The merchant wallet address needs to have the corresponding trust lines set up for the stablecoins you want to accept.

## Test Payments

1. Go to the extension settings in WordPress admin (").
2. Enable the Testnet mode.
3. Use a test XRP Ledger account to make test payments.
4. You can create test accounts from https://xrpl.org/xrp-testnet-faucet.html for XRP or https://tryrlusd.com/ for RLUSD.

## External Services
LedgerDirect uses public APIs from Coinbase, Coingecko, Binance, and Kraken to retrieve current cryptocurrency exchange rates. These rates are needed to correctly calculate and display payments.

No personal or payment data is sent to these services. Only requests for current rates are made when a payment is processed or displayed.
